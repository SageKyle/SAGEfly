my name is **Ominyi Paul**,
I'm a front-end web developer.
I'm really enthusiastic about technology and I believe in it can be used to solve most of our current societal problems, especially here on the African continent.
I aspire to use technology to reach out to people both far and near, and to impart their lives in any positve way I can.

I love community service because it's one way to make someone smile even if he/she is a stranger. 

I believe in the slogan: *A Smile Is Worth A Thousand Pictures*

Please don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any work for me.
